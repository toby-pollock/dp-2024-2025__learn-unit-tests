# TP - FizzBuzz

## Objectives
- Make your first steps with TDD

## Context
In the `src/main/java/fr/anthonyquere/fizzbuzz` directory, there is a new Java class called `FizzBuzz`.

It contains a main method and a method called `startFizzBuzz` that returns a list of strings.

Associated to this file, there is a test class called `FizzBuzzTest` (in the `src/test/java/fr/anthonyquere/fizzbuzz` directory).

Currently, all tests fails.

## Tasks
### Implements your tests
Start by reading each tests name and their wanted output.

Implement the code to make the tests pass.

No need to try to do all of them at once, just go one by one, take your time.
